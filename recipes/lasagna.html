        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul><li><strong>Beef:</strong> This recipe calls for ground beef, but you can use ground turkey for a lighter take. </li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Fresh produce:</strong> Aside from the zucchini, you'll also need a green bell pepper, an onion, and mushrooms from the produce aisle.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Frozen spinach:</strong> Frozen spinach is a convenient, colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient. </li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> A combination tomato paste and tomato sauce.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Wine:</strong> Red wine enhances the overall flavor.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Cheese:</strong> You'll need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta mixture together, preventing runniness. </li></ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; set aside to drain in a colander.</li>
            <li>To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of hot water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Spread parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Tip from recipe creator:</strong> "The lasagna can be assembled a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to bake. You may need to lenghten the baking time.</p>
