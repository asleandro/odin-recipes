        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li><strong>Eggplant:</strong> You'll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Sausage:</strong> This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Pasta sauce:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Cheese:</strong> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li></ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.</li>
            <li>Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces.</li>

            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown.

            <li>Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
